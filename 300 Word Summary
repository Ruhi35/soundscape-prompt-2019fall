My audacity file currently contains the sounds of a suitcase rolling, a zipper zipping, and a car 
driving in the rain. It's not really coherent at all, and there's no clear vision to the soundscape. 
This is really reflective of how I don't really have any clue about what I want my narrative to be.
I'm struggling to think of an idea, or what I want to get across, so having to have even a rough draft 
of a rough draft is proving to be difficult. I kind of had a vague idea around showing the contrast between 
how vacation can feel stressful and relaxing at the same time. I was thinking about how people stress and stress
while they plan and they stress while they travel to their destination and the relaxation portion of it
is minimal compared to how much it takes to put everything together. This is at least vacation as I know it.
I did not imagine there to be any human voices in the soundscape originally, but I am not sure how to create
this image in someone's mind with sound. I did want to include the sounds of a person sighing as the relaxation 
began, and there were going to be waves in the background, and then the stress would pick back up after because then 
you have to go back to real life and work again.
